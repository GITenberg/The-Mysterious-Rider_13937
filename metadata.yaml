description: Rancher Bill Belllounds brought up Columbine as though she were his daughter.
  Out of affection for her foster father, Columbine agrees to marry his son Jack,
  who is a drunkard, gambler, coward, and thief. But she really loves the cowboy,
  Wilson Moore. Then, the Mysterious Rider appears at the Belllounds ranch, a man
  of middle age, gentle, kindly, but so formidable a gun fighter he has earned the
  nickname Hell Bent Wade.
